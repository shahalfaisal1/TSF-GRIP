### Spark Foundation Internship - Task 1: Regression Analysis
This repository contains my solution to Task 1 of the Spark Foundation Internship program. The task involves implementing regression analysis using the Python Scikit-Learn library to predict the percentage of marks a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied.


# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of two variables: "Hours" and "Scores". The "Hours" variable represents the number of hours a student studied, while the "Scores" variable represents the corresponding percentage of marks achieved by the student.



# Approach
To perform the regression analysis, I used the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: I started by loading the dataset and performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data
Data Visualization: I created visualizations to understand the relationship between the "Hours" and "Scores" variables and identify any patterns or trends.
Model Training: Using the Scikit-Learn library, I split the dataset into training and testing sets. Then, I selected a regression algorithm, such as Linear Regression, and trained it on the training set.
Model Evaluation: After training the regression model, I evaluated its performance using Mean Absolute Error. This step helped me understand how well the model fits the data and its predictive capabilities.
Prediction: Finally, I used the trained model to make predictions on new data. In this case, I used it to predict the percentage of marks based on the number of hours studied.

# Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

Python 3.x
Scikit-Learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib


# Results
The regression analysis performed in this task provides insights into the relationship between the number of hours studied and the percentage of marks achieved by students. The trained regression model can be used to predict the expected percentage of marks based on the number of hours studied.

By completing this task, I gained hands-on experience in implementing regression analysis using Scikit-Learn and applying it to real-world data.


# Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the Spark Foundation for providing this internship opportunity and the dataset used for analysis. This task has enhanced my understanding of machine learning concepts and their practical applications.
